/** Get the intersection of the instance and another sub-line.
     * <p>
     * This method is related to the {@link Line#intersection(Line)
     * intersection} method in the {@link Line Line} class, but in addition
     * to compute the point along infinite lines, it also checks the point
     * lies on both sub-line ranges.
     * </p>
     * @param subLine other sub-line which may intersect instance
     * @param includeEndPoints if true, endpoints are considered to belong to
     * instance (i.e. they are closed sets) and may be returned, otherwise endpoints
     * are considered to not belong to instance (i.e. they are open sets) and intersection
     * occurring on endpoints lead to null being returned
     * @return the intersection point if there is one, null if the sub-lines don't intersect
