/**
     * Tries to remove n if it is an unconditional branch node (break, continue,

     * That is, if removing n preserves the control flow. Also if n targets
     * another unconditional branch, this function will recursively try to
     * remove the target branch as well. The reason why we want to cascade this
     * removal is because we only run this pass once. If we have code such as
     *
     * break -> break -> break
     *
     * where all 3 breaks are useless, then the order of removal matters. When
     * we first look at the first break, we see that it branches to the 2nd
     * break. However, if we remove the last break, the 2nd break becomes
     * useless and finally the first break becomes useless as well.
     *
     * @returns The target of this jump. If the target is also useless jump,
     *     the target of that useless jump recursively.
