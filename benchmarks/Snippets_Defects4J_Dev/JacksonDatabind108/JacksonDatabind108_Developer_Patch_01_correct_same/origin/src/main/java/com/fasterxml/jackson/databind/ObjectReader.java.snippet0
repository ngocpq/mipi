/**
     * Convenience method that binds content read using given parser, using
     * configuration of this reader, except that content is bound as
     * JSON tree instead of configured root value type.
     * Returns {@link JsonNode} that represents the root of the resulting tree, if there
     * was content to read, or {@code null} if no more content is accessible
     * via passed {@link JsonParser}.
     *<p>
     * NOTE! Behavior with end-of-input (no more content) differs between this
     * {@code readTree} method, and all other methods that take input source: latter
     * will return "missing node", NOT {@code null}
     *<p>
     * Note: if an object was specified with {@link #withValueToUpdate}, it
     * will be ignored.
     *<p>
     * NOTE: this method never tries to auto-detect format, since actual
     * (data-format specific) parser is given.
