/**
   * Tries to remove n if an unconditional branch node (break, continue or

   * we remove n, the control flow remains the same. Also if n targets to
   * another unconditional branch, this function will recursively try to remove
   * the target branch as well. The reason why we want to cascade this removal
   * is because we only run this pass once. If we have code such as
   *
   * break -> break -> break
   *
   * where all 3 break's are useless. The order of removal matters. When we
   * first look at the first break, we see that it branches to the 2nd break.
   * However, if we remove the last break, the 2nd break becomes useless and
   * finally the first break becomes useless as well.
   *
   * @return The target of this jump. If the target is also useless jump,
   *     the target of that useless jump recursively.
